## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

This EFI is only meant for the Lenovo ThinkPad X270. I am NOT responsible for any harm caused to your device or mental health caused by attempting a Hackintosh. You have been warned.

In order to get iServices and other functionality working, you must fill in your own MLB, ROM, Serial, and UUID information. You can do so by using [GenSMBios][gensmbios] and using the SMBIOS for a `MacBookPro15,2`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Post-install tweaks

I recommend doing the following to get your system as smooth as possible:

1. Enable Tap to Click in System Settings -> Trackpad üôÑ
2. Disable hibernation, powernap, and some other power settings

   ```sh
    sudo pmset autopoweroff 0
    sudo pmset powernap 0
    sudo pmset standby 0
    sudo pmset proximitywake 0
    sudo pmset tcpkeepalive 0
   ```

3. If you're running a 1080p internal display, check out [BetterDisplay][betterdisplay] and run 1280x720@2x for HiDPI support
4. Use [Boom 2][boom2] to boost the speaker output as by default it's quite quiet. Note that this is not a free application!
